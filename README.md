# Food_Ordering_System
In that project, I developed a Web-based application to provide all foods information to the customer's needs and customers can buy these foods. 
For example, in this application at first, a customer will see a home page. Different Categories of foods 
will be displayed on the home page. If a customer wants to add the food to his cart, then first, he/she has 
to log in. If the customer is not registered then he/she has to register. After that he/she can order the 
food.
